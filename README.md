# Intelligent Air Traffic Analytics — Enhanced with Dynamic Medallion Architecture


Deliver actionable, real-time, and predictive insights to airports, airlines, and regulators. The platform leverages Databricks’ scalable medallion architecture (bronze, silver, gold layers), dynamic data modeling, and automated pipelines for maximum flexibility, cost-efficiency, and speed.

## Approach to Solution

### 1. The Core Components

- **Data Ingestion (Bronze)**
  - Use Databricks Auto Loader for continuous, scalable ingestion of raw air traffic, flight telemetry, weather, and operational datasets.

- **Transformation (Silver)**
  - Employ DLT pipelines to cleanse, join, and enrich data.
  - Implement a **dynamic silver layer**: pipelines automatically adapt to schema changes, add new data sources, and manage evolving business logic.

- **Analytics & Modeling (Gold)**
  - Create fact and dimension tables dynamically.
  - Build flexible gold layer pipelines: new business metrics, dimensions, and facts can be added or modified without heavy refactoring.
  - Serve analytical datasets for ML models, BI dashboards, and APIs.

### The Technical Flow

- **Auto Loader** detects and ingests new files or streaming data with minimal setup and zero maintenance.
- **17 DLT pipelines** orchestrate the medallion flow:
  - Modularized: Each pipeline is responsible for a domain (flights, airports, passengers, etc.).
  - Dynamic: Schema evolution and new logic are handled with code/config changes.
- **Dynamic silver and gold layers**:
  - Use parameterized notebooks/scripts to auto-generate fact/dimension tables.
  - Automate lineage tracking and quality checks (DLT expectations).
- **Serving and Integration**:
  - Expose cleaned and modeled data to dashboards, ML models, or external systems via APIs.
  - Provide real-time and batch data products.

### 3. Business Value

- **Flexibility**: Quickly adapt to new regulations, data sources, or business needs without massive rewrites.
- **Scalability**: Handle increasing volumes and varieties of data with Databricks’ managed infrastructure.
- **Trust & Quality**: Automated data quality checks and lineage ensure transparency and compliance.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Deliver richer, more timely insights to clients, enabling them to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve safety.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Flight Delay Prediction**: Dynamically add new features (e.g., weather, crew schedules) without pipeline rewrites.
- **Passenger Flow Optimization**: Analyze and predict passenger congestion using real-time, gold-layer fact tables.
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Instantly adapt data marts for new compliance requirements.
